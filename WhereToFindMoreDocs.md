This library and its supporting code have various documentation sources:

  * First, the API documentation, contained in the header files, is the definitive source. Juice has extensive API documentation (even more than v8, actually). The headers can be processed with doxygen to produce HTML documentation.
  * The plugins are normally documented in two places. First, the header files list the exact functions which are mapped and describe any differences from their native API counterparts (if any). Secondly, some plugins have a supplemental library manual (in OpenDocument Text format).
  * Documentation for v8 can be found at http://code.google.com/apis/v8/
